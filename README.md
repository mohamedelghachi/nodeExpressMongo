**Description:**
This project builds upon the previous Node.js Soccer Team API, but utilizes Mongoose to establish a connection with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval. This offers a more robust and scalable solution compared to using a JSON file.

**Key Features:**
* **Mongoose Integration:** Leverages Mongoose for seamless interaction with MongoDB, simplifying data modeling and operations.
* **MongoDB Database:** Employs MongoDB as a NoSQL database, providing flexibility and efficient handling of complex data structures.
* **RESTful API Design (Optional):** While not strictly essential for basic functionality, consider adhering to RESTful principles for consistent and predictable interactions with the API.
  
**Data Storage:**
* **MongoDB:** Stores team data in a MongoDB database, ensuring scalability and advanced querying capabilities.
  
**Installation and Usage:**
* **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js, npm (or yarn), and MongoDB installed on your system.
* **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.
* **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install required dependencies.
* **Configure MongoDB Connection:** Update the `index.js` file (or environment variables) with your MongoDB connection details (host, port, database name).
* **Run Server:** Start the API server by executing node `index.js` (or `yarn start` if using a start script in your `package.json`).
